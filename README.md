A web and mobile application for IOS and Android. This repo contains a report of the in-store analytics based on time inside a business geo-fence. To accurately show the user distribution, we used Pandas and Plotly to chart the duration inside in seconds. The following steps are how we collected the data from a third party back-end host [Back4App](https://www.back4app.com). 

1. Clean the data by checking to see if there are any null values.





### Libraries

Imported the following libraries to clean and visualize the data:

* Import pandas
  ```
  import pandas as pd
  ```
  * Import numpy
  ``` 
  import numpy as np
  ```
  * import matplotlib.pyplot
  ```
